"""tests/test_vendored_decision_parity.py -- the decision-model client vendored from atrium-page-classification.

ufal/atrium-project#83 runs decision models (Clef, Clef-Flash, Strands Decider 2B, served at
``POST /v1/systemone``) in four tools through one client, ``decision_client.py``, owned by
atrium-page-classification (its #58). This repository is to use it offline only, in ``dm_run.py``'s
line mode (#3, the vocabulary descent, not written yet); the service and the batch CLIs never import
it, so it is not in ``.github/production-image.json``. The document type it once asked
(``--doc-type``) is gone: a type is form, read from images by atrium-digital-convert, and this
repository reads text, so it decides content only (ufal/atrium-project#83).

The copy is pinned by the SHA-256 of the page-classification file it was taken from (line endings
normalised to ``\\n``). A mismatch means a local edit to a vendored file -- make the change in
atrium-page-classification instead -- or a re-vendor without updating the pin.

To re-vendor: copy it from a sibling ``../atrium-page-classification`` checkout, run
``python3 tests/test_vendored_decision_parity.py`` and paste the printed pin over ``VENDORED`` and
``ADOPTED``. Commit the copy and the pins together (atrium-project docs/shared_components.md).

When an atrium-page-classification checkout sits next to this repo, the copy is also compared with it
byte for byte; that check is skipped when the checkout is absent (CI).
